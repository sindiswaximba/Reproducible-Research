The Beach Birds dataset contains observations of shorebird behavior collected during an experiment conducted in Australia. In this study, a car was driven down the length of a beach while observers recorded bird responses. The dataset focuses on two key measurements: flush distance, the distance at which a bird moves away when approached, and land distance, the distance the bird landed from its original position. Both distances are measured in meters (m).

The dataset includes five columns. Column 1, Site, identifies the location where the bird was observed and is recorded as a categorical variable (e.g., Site1, Site2, etc.). Column 2, Species, records the common name of the bird species observed (e.g., Oystercatcher, Plover). Column 3, Sex, indicates the sex of the bird and can be either Female or Male. Column 4, Flush distance, is numeric and represents the distance in meters from the approaching car to the bird at which it flushed. Column 5, Land distance, is numeric and represents the distance in meters the bird flew before landing again on the beach. Each row in the dataset corresponds to a single bird observation.
